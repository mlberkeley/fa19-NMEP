# Introduction to Tensorflow
Please submit each notebook by the below deadline to gradescope. This is just to keep you on pace to complete the homeworks in time.

NOTE: Deadlines have been shifted around.

**DEADLINE:** Sunday (10/20)
1. Start with `neural_network.py`. In this file you will be implementing a neural network from scratch using numpy! This is a tough one! Feel free to consult Google or anyone in the club if you need help!

**DEADLINE:** Tuesday (10/22)

2. Do the Tenorflow Tutorial notebook. You should finish this notebook by Saturday.

**DEADLINE:** Thursday (10/24) --> For both of these

3. Next, you will be implementing a Denoising Autoencoder in tensorflow! In this homework you will gain more tf experience and train a model on AWS! 

4. Finish with the Keras is Cool notebook. This will introduce you to Keras. It should not take too long and is not nearly as important as the other homeworks.
