# Introduction to Tensorflow
Please submit each notebook by the below deadline to gradescope.

**DEADLINE:** Saturday (10/19)

2. Do the Tenorflow Tutorial notebook. You should finish this notebook by Saturday.

**DEADLINE:** Monday (10/21) --> For both of these

3. Next, you will be implementing a Denoising Autoencoder in tensorflow! In this homework you will gain more tf experience and train a model on AWS! 

4. Finish with the Keras is Cool notebook. This will introduce you to Keras. It should not take too long and is not nearly as important as the other homeworks.

**DEADLINE:** Thursday (10/24)
NOTE: This is not been pushed to github yet.... will be release in the near future. 
1. Start with `neural_network.py`. In this file you will be implementing a neural network from scratch using numpy! Don't worry tho...there is plenty of guidance and if you have any questions feel free to reach out.
